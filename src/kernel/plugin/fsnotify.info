fsnotify standard

fsnotify is short for File System NOTIFY. The name referenced linux's inofity.
And works on it (under linux, if fanotify hasn't been ready).

The workflow:
+ fsnotify is initialized
+ when the watching directory is changed, an add/delete list is given to
fsnotify's function (this function should return immediately)
+ fsnotify register/unregister these directories (asynchronized)
	- plugin should call kernel api to manipulate the list after every registory
+ after all these directory is processed, the fsnotify plugin should call the
API to ack lain the work has done.

plugin should provide a progress interface.
