<> header: defines data types, placed at <platform>/
"" header: online defines functions, placed at ., implementations placed at
	<platform>/

file io: using fstream(linux), or wfstream(win32), type abstracted as filestream
serialization: using boost::serialization
	- archive: using boost::xml_[i/o]archive(linux), or
	  boost::xml_w[i/o]archive, abstracted as barc_[i/o]

partition: using an int64_t as an index, counting from 1
	using boost::uuids::uuid as unique locator,
	storing an device string as methods to refer partition,
		for windows, it stores \\?\Volume{GUID}, it is dumplicated from uuid
		for linux, it stores the block device
		+ this field is filled by scan_online_partitons

partition locators:
	the values stored by this data structure are mostly read by human, not
	program, so a map<string, string> is good enough.

tracing:
	partition, relative path are XP
	watching are not XP, as fanotify watches pathes but NTFS watches volumns
