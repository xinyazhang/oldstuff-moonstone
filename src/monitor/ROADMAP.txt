First, a win32 daemon shall be written.

main
	- daemonize (stub)
	- open default configuration files
	- load known partitions and locators
		- de-serialize partitions objects from "Partition"
			- each partition object contains locators
		- partitions information should contain ``last traced'' timestamp, for NTFS, USN is one additional information.
	- enumerate online partitions
	- load tracing paths
	- create hooks on tracing paths 
		! Below is NTFS-specified
		- Find Volumes for paths (CreateFile is OK)
		- Open these Volumes
		- Start a thread for each Volume, and passes relative paths of each volume
			- [each thread] read USN DATA...
			- pass to the journal thread
		- start a journal thread to write events to files.
			- we need a "tail" like command to parse the file...
	- The service never exits
		- How to write a NT service?
