First, a win32 daemon shall be written.

main
	- daemonize (stub)
	- open default configuration files
	- load known partitions and locators
		- de-serialize partitions objects from "Partition"
			- each partition object contains locators
		- partitions information should contain ``last traced'' timestamp, for NTFS, USN is one additional information.
	- enumerate online partitions
	- load tracing paths
	- create hooks on tracing paths 
		! Below is NTFS-specified
		- Find Volumes for paths (CreateFile is OK)
		- Open these Volumes
		- Start a thread for each Volume, and passes relative paths of each volume
			- [each thread] read USN DATA...
			- pass to the journal thread
		- start a journal thread to write events to files.
			- we need a "tail" like command to parse the file...
	- The service never exits
		- How to write a NT service?


Milestone 1
	GOAL:	write a NT service as well as a normal process
	TEST:	- Register the service and start it and the configuration file
			  should be written "OK"
			- Do the same with the process

Milestone 2
	GOAL:	write a daemon which could scan online partitions
	TEST:	- Run the daemon with null configure file, check the configure file
			- Run the daemon with configure file whose one item was deleted,
			  check the configure file
			- Run the daemon with a corrupt configure file, check the
			  configure file
	NOTE: These tests are done without service

Milestone 3
	GOAL:	write a daemon could index paths and changes[NTFS]
	TEST:	- Run the daemon with configure file which daemon paths were
			written, touch filesystems and then check the journal file
	
Milestone 4
	GOAL:	write a daemon providing services with IPC
	TEST:	- Run the daemon with configure file, using a client to start
			  an index query, and check the file written by the client 
			- Run the daemon with configure file, using a client to query
			  change journal, and check the file written by the client
