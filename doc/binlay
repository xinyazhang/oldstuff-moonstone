DOCUMENTS ON BINARY LAYOUTS OF INTRA-PROCESS DATABASE OBJECTS

1. APPLICATION INTERFACE
	Every class should has a cooresponding
		+ QDataStream& operator<<(T );
	function for writing to QDataStream and a
		+ QDataStream& operator>>(T& );
	function for reading from QDataStream

	If current cursor of QDataStream do not represent object of corresponding
	class, the current object should be skipped

2. BINARY INTERFACE
	BYTE 0			OBJECT CLASS
	BYTE 1~4		OBJECT PAYLOAD LENGTH (denoted as N)
	BYTE 5~N-1+5	OBJECT CONTEXT

3. PACK OF OBJECT
	Currently the objects are not packed, the user of the objects shold keep
	the metadata of the blobs (i.e. the QDataStream do not store it is a pack
	of database objects, or not)

4. SPECIFICATIONS
	tag:
			<NONE>
		it does not have an binlay as it does not have sufficient data as SACs
	tnode:
			UINT64	idx
		it does not have to contain a mastername as other module could access
		it from DB.
	relation:
			UINT64 tagger
			UINT64 taggee
	fso:
			UINT64 fsoid
			UINT64 parent
